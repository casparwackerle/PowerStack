\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro_motivation}

Global data center energy consumption is increasing rapidly, driven by the rising demand for
compute-heavy workloads such as artificial intelligence and large-scale analytics.
Data centers consumed roughly 1.5\% of global electricity in 2024
(about 415~TWh) and are expected to more than double their consumption by 2030
\parencite{iea2025energyai}.  
At the same time, traditional sources of efficiency improvement, such as Moore's law and 
Dennard scaling, are slowing down \parencite{tomshardware2023mooreslaw, cartesian2013dennard}, 
while gains from infrastructure optimizations approach diminishing returns 
\parencite{uptime2023pue, masanet2020}.

Containerized workloads form an increasingly large share of this growing footprint.
They provide lightweight and scalable deployment mechanisms \parencite{Potdar2020}, and
Kubernetes has become the dominant platform for orchestrating such workloads at scale.
Despite their operational benefits and generally low overhead \parencite{Morabito2015},
containers make energy transparency difficult. Their shared-resource architecture and
multi-layer abstraction obscure the relationship between individual workloads and the
physical energy they consume, which complicates research on energy efficiency. As interest
in energy-aware computing grows, accurate and fine-grained measurement becomes essential
for research, performance engineering, and scheduling. Existing tools offer useful
approximations but rely heavily on heuristic models and asynchronous telemetry, which
limits their validity and reproducibility.

\textit{Kepler}\parencite{kepler_current}, a CNCF-backed project under active development, has become a widely adopted energy observability tool for Kubernetes clusters. Its design prioritizes portability,
low overhead, and safe deployment across diverse environments, which makes it highly
suitable for operational use at scale. A detailed analysis of its methodology and
design philosophy is provided in \hyperref[appendix_vt2]{Appendix~A}. In this context, Tycho is not intended
to compete with Kepler or replace it. Instead, Tycho explores a complementary space:
the upper bound of what measurement accuracy is achievable when higher-privilege
monitoring methods, synchronized server-wide telemetry, and more fine-grained event-time 
alignment are permitted. While such techniques are often impractical for general-purpose
deployments, they offer substantial value for research settings and large-scale R\&D
environments that require precise and reproducible energy measurements. Tycho is an
attempt to fill this accuracy-focused niche by implementing methods that prioritize
measurement fidelity over broad deployability.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Challenges and Limitations of Existing Approaches}
\label{sec:intro_teaser_limitations}

Current approaches to workload-level energy estimation provide useful insights but remain
limited in accuracy and reproducibility. Tools such as Kepler and Scaphandre\parencite{scaphandre_github} correlate resource utilization metrics with node-level energy telemetry, yet they operate under
constraints that make fine-grained attribution difficult. Many systems depend on
asynchronous and low-frequency sampling, rely on heterogeneous telemetry sources with
differing clock domains, or employ heuristic models that introduce uncertainty. Purpose-built,
high-accuracy measurement hardware exists, but its cost and operational overhead prevent
widespread adoption in production environments. As a result, most available
solutions offer high-level trends rather than precise, time-aligned measurements required
for rigorous analysis. A more detailed discussion of these limitations is provided in
\S~\ref{ch:background_and_related_work} and further expanded in \hyperref[appendix_vt2]{Appendix~A}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Problem Context}
\label{sec:intro_context}

Modern container platforms such as Kubernetes run large numbers of heterogeneous,
short-lived workloads on shared physical infrastructure. In multi-tenant clusters,
containers continuously start, stop, migrate, and compete for CPU, memory, storage,
and I/O resources. This dynamism complicates any attempt to determine how much energy
a specific workload is responsible for.

At the hardware level, telemetry relevant to energy measurement is fragmented across
multiple subsystems. Interfaces such as Intel RAPL, Redfish power sensors, GPU
telemetry, and eBPF-based utilization metrics differ in sampling frequency, latency,
and clock domain. Their values may arrive asynchronously and with inconsistent timing,
making direct alignment difficult. Reliable attribution requires correlating these
subsystems to a common time base, which existing platforms do not provide.

Kubernetes adds another layer of complexity. Processes are encapsulated inside
containers, which in turn map to pods, cgroups, and namespaces that evolve over time.
Accurate attribution therefore depends on robust tracking of process-to-container
relationships and on resolving the timing mismatch between telemetry sources and the
rapid state changes within the cluster. These combined factors make precise,
container-level energy attribution a challenging problem.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Positioning Within Previous Work}
\label{sec:intro_positioning}

This thesis builds directly on two earlier specialization projects completed as part of the 
Master's program. The first project (VT1) focused on the practical deployment of a 
bare-metal Kubernetes environment for energy efficiency research. It provided a fully 
automated setup procedure for cluster installation, persistent storage, monitoring 
infrastructure, and stress-test workloads, including all required configuration and 
connectivity. VT1 initially deployed Kepler as its energy monitoring component but has 
since been adapted to install Tycho instead, enabling rapid provisioning of complete 
measurement and evaluation environments. The resulting \textit{PowerStack} repository 
\parencite{Powerstack} works in conjunction with this thesis by providing the operational 
foundation on which Tycho can be deployed and evaluated, and is documented in 
\hyperref[appendix_vt1]{Appendix~B}.

The second project (VT2) examined the theoretical foundations of energy measurement in 
modern servers and containerized environments. It analyzed hardware-level telemetry 
interfaces, attribution challenges, and the strengths and limitations of existing tools, 
providing a structured overview of the state of the art. VT2 identified the methodological 
gaps that hinder precise workload-level energy attribution, many of which motivate the 
design choices in Tycho. A detailed version of this analysis is included in 
\hyperref[appendix_vt2]{Appendix~A}.

The present thesis consolidates these two lines of work. It integrates the practical insights 
from VT1 with the theoretical findings of VT2 and develops Tycho as an accuracy-first system 
for server-wide energy measurement and workload attribution. In this role, the thesis serves 
as the point where the implementation, methodological foundations, and design philosophy 
come together into a coherent system.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Scope and Boundaries}
\label{sec:intro_scope}
% Clarify what this thesis covers and what it does not:
% INCLUDED:
% - Server-wide energy measurement (CPU, GPU, platform).
% - Process-level attribution using Kubernetes metadata.
% - Development of a unified timing and synchronization model.
% - Design and implementation of Tycho as a prototype system.
%
% EXCLUDED:
% - Providing a production-ready autoscaler or scheduler.
% - Prediction models or long-term forecasting of energy consumption.
% - Modifying Kubernetes itself.
% - Vendor-specific proprietary APIs beyond RAPL, NVML, and Redfish.
% - Energy-aware orchestration policies.
%
% The goal is a research prototype focused on accuracy, not a turnkey product.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Target Audience}
\label{sec:intro_audience}
% Explain who Tycho is intended for.
% Tycho's accuracy-first design comes with drawbacks:
% - It is more complex than typical observability tools.
% - It requires specific privileges (eBPF, RAPL access, or BMC polling).
% - It produces low-level telemetry rather than high-level abstractions.
%
% Therefore, Tycho is primarily aimed at:
% - Academic researchers studying energy efficiency.
% - Infrastructure and performance engineering teams in hyperscalers.
% - Experimental environments where measurement accuracy is more important than ease of deployment.
%
% For typical operational users or standard SRE environments, Tycho may be excessive.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Origin of the Name ``Tycho''}
\label{sec:intro_name}
% Provide a short explanation of the naming:
% Kepler is the upstream project, named after Johannes Kepler.
% Tycho Brahe was Kepler's mentor and provided the precise astronomical measurements
% that allowed Kepler to derive his laws of planetary motion.
%
% The analogy:
% - Kepler (the tool) builds models and estimates.
% - Tycho (this project) focuses on precise and accurate raw measurement.
%
% The naming signals both continuity and a philosophical shift toward accuracy-first design.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Methodological Approach}
\label{sec:intro_methodology}
% Provide a short overview of the research methodology.
% Suggested structure:
% - Start with requirements analysis and conceptual design.
% - Develop independent metric collectors and a timing engine.
% - Use iterative implementation with continuous integration on a real Kubernetes cluster.
% - Validate correctness through controlled experiments (planned for VT3).
%
% Keep this section short and focus on the workflow, not the technical details.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Ethical and Sustainability Considerations}
\label{sec:intro_ethics}
% Keep this short.
% Mention:
% - Energy transparency contributes to more efficient resource use in data centers.
% - Research tools like Tycho enable more rigorous energy evaluations and can support sustainability goals.
% - No personal or sensitive data is collected; measurements are technical and device-oriented.
% - Ethical considerations primarily relate to promoting efficient cloud operation and reproducible research.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

% Provide a brief outline of the upcoming chapters:
% - Chapter 2: Background and related work.
% - Chapter 3: Requirements and design goals of Tycho.
