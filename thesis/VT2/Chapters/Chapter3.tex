\chapter{Analysis of Energy Consumption Tools} % Main chapter title
\label{Chapter3}


\section{Introduction}

    Purpose of tool analysis and its role in your hybrid model.

    Explain categories:

        General Server Monitoring

        Container-Level Monitoring

\section{General Server Monitoring Tools}

    PowerSensor3, Powertop, Green Metrics Tool, Kavanagh 2019.

    Focus on system-wide measurement.

    Capabilities and limitations.

\section{Container-Level Monitoring Tools}

    KEPLER, Scaphandre, Smartwatts, JoularJX, AI Power Meter, CodeCarbon.

    Granularity down to the container level.

    Discuss their internal mechanisms (e.g., eBPF, RAPL, NVML).

    Advantages and drawbacks.

\section{Comparison of Tools}

    Detailed matrix comparing:

        Measurement methodology.

        Component focus (CPU, RAM, GPU, Disk, Network).

        Real-time capabilities.

        Kubernetes compatibility.

\section{Conclusion and Selection for VT2 Research}

    Justify which tools will be part of your VT2 methodology.

    Discuss limitations of the discarded tools.
