\section{Tools}
\subsection{RAPL-based tools}
\label{sec:rapltools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \parencite{jay2023experimental} An experimental comparison of software-based power meters (focus on CPU / GPU)
    \item \parencite{van2025powersensor3} fast accurate opensource: PowerSensor3 enables real-time power measurements of SoC boards and PCIe cards, including GPUs, FPGAs, NICs, SSDs, and domain-specific AI and ML accelerators
    \item \parencite{kavanagh2019rapid} Rapid and accurate energy models through calibration with IPMI and RAPL
    \item \parencite{scaphandre_documentation} Scaphandre. Does not handle overflows correctly (https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre/issues/280)
    \item \parencite{fieni2020smartwatts} Smartwatts: Self-Calibrating Software-Defined Power Meter for containers
    \item \parencite{joularjx} JoularJX: jaba-based agent for power monitoring at the code level
    \item \parencite{kepler_energy}: KEPLER
    \item \parencite{aipowermeter}: "AI power meter": Library to measure energy usage of machine learning programs, uses RAPL for CPU and nvidia-smi for GPU
    \item \parencite{codecarbon} CodeCarbon: Python package, estimates GPU + CPU + RAM: uses pynvml, ram RATIO (3W for 8G) and RAPL. According to Raffin2024, this tool does not account for the MSR overflow: https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/issues/322 -> apparently fixed now
    \item \parencite{powertop}: powertop
    \item \parencite{greencodingdocs}: Green metrics tool: measuring energy and CO2 consumption of software through a software life cycle anslysis (SLCA): Metric providers: RAPL, IPMI, PSU, Docker, Temperature, CPU, ... (sone external devices)
    
    according to raffin2024: simplified versions of scaphandre and codecarbon hhve 3\%, 0.5\% overhead at 10Hz
    according to \parencite{jay2023experimental}, the full versions have between 2 and 7\% at 1Hz.
