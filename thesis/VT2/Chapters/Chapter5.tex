\chapter{Designing a Container Power Attribution Architecture} % Main chapter title
\label{Chapter5}


    5.1 Design Goals
        Generalizability, minimal overhead, real-time capability, etc.
    5.2 Architecture Components
        Metric sources, data aggregation, correlation layer, exporter
    5.3 Attribution Logic
        CPU (RAPL + cgroups), RAM, NET, DISK, idle, system
    5.4 Proposed Correlation Model
        Hybrid models (e.g. direct for CPU, proportional for network)
    5.5 Open Questions and Future Improvements


Notes
    VM nesting (like scaphandre) in Kepler
    explicitely handle PID0, idle task
