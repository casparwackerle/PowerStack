\chapter{Methodology for Evaluation and Benchmarking} % Main chapter title
\label{Chapter6}

    6.1 Requirements for Evaluation
        Ground-truth measurement, reproducibility, load generation
    6.2 Testbed Design
        Kubernetes cluster layout, benchmarking tools (e.g., stress-ng, fio, iperf3)
    6.3 Benchmarking Scenarios
        Synthetic benchmarks (CPU/memory-heavy, IO-heavy, mixed)
        Real-world workloads (web apps, ML inference, etc.)
    6.4 Evaluation Metrics
        Attribution accuracy, overhead, scalability, stability
